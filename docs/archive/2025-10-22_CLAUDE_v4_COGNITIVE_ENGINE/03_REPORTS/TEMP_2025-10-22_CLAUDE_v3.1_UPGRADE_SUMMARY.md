## ✅ New Sections Added (MCO-Inspired Patterns)

### 1. § CRITICAL FIRST STEP (Lines 7-21)

**Purpose**: Pre-flight checklist before tests/development
**Lines**: 15
**Value**: Prevents most common setup errors

```markdown
## § CRITICAL FIRST STEP

**ALWAYS verify before tests:**
```bash
echo $TEST_DATABASE_URL  # Must be set
echo $EMBEDDING_MODE     # Should be "mock"
make up
curl http://localhost:8001/health
```

⚠️ Violate = pollute dev DB or 2-minute model loading
```

**Impact**:
- Catches CRITICAL-01 violation before it happens
- Saves 2 minutes per test run (EMBEDDING_MODE=mock)
- Single source of pre-flight checks

---

### 2. § CURRENT STATE (Lines 24-31)

**Purpose**: Project status at-a-glance
**Lines**: 8
**Value**: Immediate context for any session

```markdown
## § CURRENT STATE

**Completed EPICs**: EPIC-06 (74pts) | EPIC-07 (41pts) | EPIC-08 (24pts) | EPIC-11 (13pts) | EPIC-12 (13pts)
**In Progress**: EPIC-10 Performance & Caching (27/35pts complete)
**Next**: EPIC-10 Stories 10.4-10.5 (remaining 8pts)
**Skills Active**: 4 operational
**Branch**: migration/postgresql-18
```

**Impact**:
- Onboarding: New session knows immediately where we are
- Context: Claude understands current focus
- Tracking: Progress visible at-a-glance

---

### 3. § ANTI-PATTERNS (Lines 85-102)

**Purpose**: Explicit NEVER list (proactive prevention)
**Lines**: 18
**Value**: Prevents errors before they happen

```yaml
NEVER:
  1. run.tests.without.TEST_DATABASE_URL
  2. use.sync.db.operations
  3. rebuild.from.scratch
  4. skip.Protocol.implementation
  5. ignore.skills.knowledge
  6. use.EMBEDDING_MODE=real.in.tests
  7. modify.code.without.reading.first
  8. create.new.files.when.editing.works

Response.on.violation: 🚫 Anti-Pattern: [name] | Use: [alternative]
```

**Impact**:
- Proactive: Prevents vs corrects
- Explicit: NEVER list clearer than "should" rules
- Actionable: Each has consequence + alternative

**Difference from §CRITICAL.RULES**:
- CRITICAL.RULES = what to DO
- ANTI-PATTERNS = what to NEVER do
- Complementary approaches

---

### 4. § ENFORCEMENT GATES (Lines 77-81)

**Purpose**: Pre-flight validation before operations
**Lines**: 5 (integrated into §CRITICAL.RULES)
**Value**: Automated guardrails

```markdown
**Enforcement Gates** (pre-flight checks before operations):
- TEST.Gate: IF pytest ∧ ¬TEST_DATABASE_URL → REJECT ∵ dev.DB.pollution
- ASYNC.Gate: IF db.operation ∧ ¬await → REJECT ∵ RuntimeWarning
- PROTOCOL.Gate: IF new.repo|service ∧ ¬Protocol → REJECT ∵ DIP.violation
- EXTEND.Gate: IF rebuild.from.scratch ∧ existing.pattern.exists → REJECT ∵ 10x.slower
```

**Impact**:
- Validation: Before operation, not after error
- Logic: IF/THEN gates clear and checkable
- Consequence: ∵ (because) explains why REJECT

---

### 5. § QUICK COMMANDS (Lines 119-158)

**Purpose**: Command reference for common operations
**Lines**: 40
**Value**: Copy-paste ready commands

**Categories**:
- Dev Cycle (make up, down, restart, logs)
- Testing (make api-test, api-test-file, api-test-one, coverage)
- Database (db-shell, db-backup, db-test-reset)
- Quick Checks (health, docs, cache stats)
- Performance (apply_optimizations.sh)

**Impact**:
- Productivity: No need to remember exact commands
- Accuracy: Copy-paste ready, no typos
- Discoverability: All commands in one place

**Note**: This section adds most lines (+40) but high utility

---

### 6. § VERSION HISTORY (Lines 190-204)

**Purpose**: Track evolution, document changes
**Lines**: 15
**Value**: Understanding architecture evolution

```markdown
## § VERSION HISTORY

**Changelog:**
- v2.3.0: Initial compressed DSL format
- v2.4.0: Added skills ecosystem metadata
- v3.0.0: Pure cognitive engine architecture (HOW/WHAT separation, -57% reduction)
- v3.1.0: +CRITICAL.FIRST.STEP +CURRENT.STATE +ANTI-PATTERNS +ENFORCEMENT.GATES +QUICK.COMMANDS +VERSION.HISTORY

**Philosophy:** Cognitive Engine + Skills Ecosystem → Progressive Disclosure → Token-Optimized

**Verification:** Option A validated (no breaking changes) → All operational ✅
```

**Impact**:
- History: Why decisions were made
- Philosophy: Core mission statement
- Validation: Proof architecture works

---

## 🔄 Modified Sections

### § CRITICAL.RULES (Enhanced)

**Added**:
- Enforcement Gates subsection (lines 77-81)
- DSL symbols: ∵ (because), ∴ (therefore)

**Kept**:
- Same top 5 critical rules
- References to skills unchanged

---

### § META (Enhanced)

**Added**:
- `Option.A.Validated: ✅ Keep current skills` (documents verification decision)
- `Optimization.Approach: Measure.First → Test.Isolated → Validate.Impact → Rollback.If.Worse` (learned from audit)

**Kept**:
- All existing content
- Philosophy unchanged
- Evolution strategy unchanged

---

### DSL Header (Enhanced)

**Added symbols**:
- `∵=because` (for enforcement gate explanations)
- `∴=therefore` (for logical conclusions)

**Before**: `§=section ◊=concept →=flow ⊕=compose ∧=AND !=critical @=ref |=OR :=def`
**After**: `§=section ◊=concept →=flow ⊕=compose ∧=AND !=critical @=ref |=OR :=def ∵=because ∴=therefore`

## 🎯 Universal Patterns Adopted from MCO

### ✅ Adopted (High Value, Universal)

| Pattern | MCO Section | MnemoLite Implementation | Lines | Value |
|---------|-------------|--------------------------|-------|-------|
| Critical First Step | § CRITICAL FIRST STEP | Setup verification checklist | 15 | High (prevents setup errors) |
| Current State | § CURRENT STATE | EPIC progress + skills status | 8 | High (immediate context) |
| Anti-Patterns | § ANTI-PATTERNS | 8 explicit NEVER rules | 18 | High (proactive prevention) |
| Enforcement Gates | § ENFORCEMENT GATES | 4 pre-flight validation gates | 5 | Medium (validation logic) |
| Quick Commands | § QUICK REFERENCE | 20+ copy-paste commands | 40 | High (productivity boost) |
| Version History | End of file | Changelog + philosophy | 15 | Medium (understanding evolution) |

**Total**: +101 lines from MCO patterns

---

### ❌ Not Adopted (MCO-Specific)

| Pattern | MCO Section | Why Not Adopted |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| Dashboard-centric | § CRITICAL FIRST STEP "ALWAYS read DASHBOARD.md" | We use skills ecosystem, not dashboard |
| Key Discovery | § KEY DISCOVERY | MCO-specific breakthrough (executable vs descriptive) |
| NO.CODE philosophy | § CORE PRINCIPLES | MnemoLite is real codebase |
| Service protocols | § SERVICES | MCO has 5 cognitive services, we have APIs/repos/services |
| Notation heavy use | Throughout MCO | We use DSL but less extensively |

---

## 📈 Impact Analysis

### Token Cost

**v3.0**: ~79 lines ≈ 500-700 tokens at startup
**v3.1**: ~204 lines ≈ 1,200-1,500 tokens at startup

**Delta**: +600-800 tokens at startup
**Trade-off**: +600 tokens for better prevention, productivity, clarity

**Skills remain unchanged**: Token cost from skills (4 × 30-50 = 120-200 tokens) unchanged

**Total context**: ~1,700 tokens (CLAUDE.md + skills metadata) - still very efficient

---

### Utility Gain

**Prevention** (Anti-Patterns + Enforcement Gates):
- Catches CRITICAL-01 before dev DB pollution
- Prevents async/await errors before RuntimeWarning
- Stops rebuild-from-scratch waste (saves 10x time)
- Validates Protocol implementation requirement

**Productivity** (Quick Commands):
- Copy-paste ready commands (no typos, no lookup)
- 20+ common operations documented
- Saves ~30 seconds per command lookup

**Context** (Current State):
- Immediate session context (no need to ask "where are we?")
- EPIC progress visible
- Branch awareness

**Understanding** (Version History):
- Architecture evolution documented
- Philosophy explicit
- Validation evidence recorded
